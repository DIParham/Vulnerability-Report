# Vulnerability-Report

This project examined vulnerabilities for a simulated company network and developed vulnerability reports based on the finding gathererd by mock security breaches and virtual machines. 

Various tools including Nmap, zenmap, NetworkMiner wireshark, metasploit, Windows Firewall, and Windows Security Essentials were utilized in the network assessment. These tools examined the points of vulnerability in which a threat actor would utilize to gain access to the company's network.

Through this assignment, I am able to demonstrate my security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in network security to expose potential vulnerabilities and mitigate them with the proper patches and security measures to better protect a company's network and data.

### Executive Summary

The purpose of this vulnerability report is to assess the overall network security of the ABC Manufacturing company. A vulnerability report would aim to provide information regarding an organization’s potential and existing weaknesses in their network security. In this case, we would be analyzing various factors in the company’s network security to determine how the current security configurations would protect the network and where it is limited. The vulnerability report would act as an outline and properly instruct the company how to better secure their network. It could be used by the company to also understand what would be most at risk during a security breach and highlight areas that should be prioritized as security improvements are made (Cytelligence, 2019).  This would allow the organization to understand the implications of a vulnerable network and the severity of it.

In determining the overall functionality of ABC Manufacturing company’s network security, a variety of tools and techniques were used. The methodology used for this assessment centered around the usage of mock security breaches, virtual machines, and access given by the ABC Manufacturing company. This allowed us to properly identify weak points in the network security that could be exploited by hackers. The tools used in this vulnerability assessment consist of several virtual machines: Kali 2 Linux, Windows Server, Windows 10, Metasploitable, Linux Sniffer, pfSense Firewall, Kali 2 Linux Attack Machine, and Windows 8.1 Attack Machine. The Attack Machines represented an external party attempting to gain access to the company’s network, whereas the other machines examined the internal network security. Aside from these tools, other components were utilized throughout the duration of this assessment. Nmap and Zenmap were tools used to identify open ports in the firewall and other machines. A pen test was conducted on the system to determine its security. Wireshark and NetworkMiner were also utilized in this assessment as they inspected the network protocols, open ports, sessions, etc. present on the network. Aside from this, the Windows firewall were used to view and configure the firewall rules. The security software, Windows Security Essentials, were also incorporated into the assessment as it allowed us to scan and protect the system from viruses and malware. 

This assessment has demonstrated that the ABC Manufacturing company has various vulnerabilities in their network security. It had been determined that the company would remain at high risk for a security breach if the proper steps to mitigate these issues are not taken. If a security breach were to occur with the network’s current state of security, it would be detrimental to the company as a whole.
